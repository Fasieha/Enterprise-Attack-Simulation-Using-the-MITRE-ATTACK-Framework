🔍Project Showcase: Enterprise Attack Simulation Using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework

Thrilled to share that our team Cyber Assassins, recently completed a comprehensive cybersecurity project focused on simulating attacks across small, medium, and large-scale enterprises using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This hands-on initiative involved:

🧠 Mapping real-world adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs):

🧩 Tailoring attack paths based on enterprise size, infrastructure complexity, and defense maturity 

🔐 Evaluating detection gaps and proposing mitigation strategies aligned with MITRE’s defense recommendations 

This project not only sharpened our understanding of the attacker’s mindset but also deepened our insights into how scalable attacks evolve across diverse organizational environments.

A huge thanks to my amazing teammates — Syed Danyal Raza , Abeeha Israr, and Muhammad Sameed Asif — for your dedication and collaboration throughout this project. 

Looking ahead to apply these insights in real-world cyber security scenarios!✨
